        <p>When You Get a Little Lonely is a studio album by American actor and singer Maureen McCormick (pictured), her only solo album, released on April 4, 1995, through the label Phantom Hill. While playing Marcia Brady in the sitcom The Brady Bunch in the 1970s, McCormick recorded four albums with the cast and a duet album with her co-star Christopher Knight. In 1994, she signed with her brother's record label and recorded When You Get a Little Lonely in Nashville, Tennessee, and Hollywood, California. McCormick selected the final track listing, fusing other genres into the album's overall country sound. Barry Coffing was the executive producer, and arranged and produced all the songs. The title track and "Tell Mama" were released as singles. The album received mainly negative reviews. Since its release, McCormick has continued to perform country music and has appeared on the reality television show Gone Country. (Full article...)</p>
